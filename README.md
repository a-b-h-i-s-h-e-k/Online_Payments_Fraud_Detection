# Online Payments Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

# Overview
- This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in online payments using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that identifies fraud while minimizing false positives. The notebook provides a complete pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment insights.

# Features

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values, outliers, and imbalanced datasets.
- Normalizes and standardizes numerical features for better model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizes key patterns in fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
- Generates feature correlations and distribution plots.

3. Machine Learning Models:
- Trains and evaluates multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Implements oversampling techniques like SMOTE to address data imbalance.

4. Performance Metrics:
- Uses precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for evaluation.
- Compares models to identify the best-performing one.

# Prerequisites
